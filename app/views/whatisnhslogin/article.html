            To access your health records or any personal information you will also need to provide high level proof of who you are. 
            If your mobile phone number matches the one you have registered with your GP, we will use it to verify your identity.
            Otherwise, you will need to provide proof of identity.

          <p>You must access a health and care website or app before you can set up an NHS login. Many of them will show the NHS login button.</p>
          <p>
            You will need to:
            <ol>
              <li>Enter your email address.</li>
              <li>Create a password.</li>
              <li>Enter the security code we email to you.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            For added security, you will need to set up Two-step verification by:
            <ol>
              <li>Providing a mobile phone or landline number.</li>
              <li>Entering the 6 digit security code we send to this number.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>To access some websites and apps, you may need to provide additional information and prove who you are. This is so we can connect you to your NHS record and protect your health information.</p>

          <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">What you need to do</h3>

          <p>A 6-digit security code will be sent to your email. You will be asked to enter this code to verify your email address and continue.</p>

          <p>Next, you will be asked to give your mobile phone number. Another 6-digit security code will be sent by text message to your mobile phone. A security code will be sent to your mobile phone every time you log in, unless you select ‘remember this device and stop sending security codes’.</p>

          <p>Right now, you cannot set up NHS login without a mobile phone. We are working on this and hope to offer a solution to users who do not own a mobile phone in the future.</p>

          <h3>Additional information</h3>

          <p>To access some websites and apps, you may need to provide some additional information to prove who you are. This is so we can connect you to your NHS record and protect your health information.</p>
