        <h3>Passport</h3>

        <p>To take a good photo of your passport make sure:
          <ul>
            <li>you have not covered any part of the page</li>
            <li>all 4 edges of the page are in your photo</li>
            <li>you can clearly see your face and all the text</li>
            <li>there's no shine from a light or window</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Other accepted ID</h3>

        <p>To take a good photo of your photo ID make sure:
          <ul>
            <li>you do not cover any of the corners</li>
            <li>you can clearly see your face and all the text</li>
            <li>there's no shine from a light or window</li>

        <!-- Black screen shows when trying to take a photo -->

        <h2 id="blackscreen">Black screen shows when trying to take a photo</h2>

        <p>
          If the camera does not open or shows a black screen when taking a photo, this may be a problem with
          permissions or a known bug in the operating system.
        </p>

        <p>
          You should make sure the web browser on your device has camera and microphone permissions. You must also give
          permission for the NHS login website to access your device’s camera and microphone.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are using an iOS device, updating the iOS operating system software on your device to a newer version
          may also help. Version 11.2 will always show a black screen when trying to open the camera.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb">Apple support article</a> that describes how to check
          for updates.

        <!-- Camera unavailable when trying to take a photo -->

        <h2 id="cameraunavailable">Camera unavailable when trying to take a photo</h2>

        <p>
          If your gallery or file manager opens instead of your camera when trying to take a photo, you may have an
          issue with permissions.
        </p>

        <p>
          You must give permission for your web browser to access the camera and microphone. If your web browser does
          not have permission, you will not be given the option to use the camera. Instead, your device's photo gallery
          or file manager app will open instead.
        </p>

        <p>
          You must also give permission for the NHS login website to access your device’s camera and microphone.
        </p>

        <p>
          If this problem keeps happening even with permissions allowed, there might be a problem with your device. You
          can try opening your camera app separately to take a photo of your ID. When you have taken a photo, you can
          then start again and prove who you are by selecting ‘upload a photo’.
        </p>

        <p>
          If this does not work, you can also try taking a photo on another device. For example, you can use another
          phone or tablet that belongs to you or a family member.

        <!-- How to give our website access permission -->

        <h2 id="ourpermission">How to give our website permission to access the camera and microphone</h2>

        <p>
          Your web browser should tell you any time a site requests access to your camera or microphone. This usually
          happens when you visit a website for the first time. You will be given the option to select ‘allow’ or
          ‘block’.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you select ‘block’ the NHS login website will not be able to access your camera or microphone. You can
          change this by going to your web browser settings.
        </p>

        <h3>Chrome</h3>

        <p>
          If you are using Google Chrome, select the icon to the left of the web page address in the address bar. This
          will allow you to view and change the permissions for the website you are on.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can also go to Chrome’s settings and select the ‘privacy and security’ tab. Select ‘site settings’ to view
          and change permissions for your camera and microphone.
        </p>

        <h3>Internet Explorer</h3>

        <p>
          If you are using Internet Explorer, go to the web browser’s settings page. Select ‘advanced settings’ and then
          ‘manage permissions’ to view and change permissions for your camera and microphone.
        </p>

        <h3>Firefox</h3>

        <p>
          If you are using Firefox, you can select the website’s icon in your address bar and click ‘more information’.
        </p>

        <p>
          Firefox also has a permissions manager that lets you see which permissions you have set up for different
          websites and change them all in one place. To access it, enter ‘about:permissions’ into your Firefox address
          bar.
        </p>

        <h3>Safari</h3>

        <p>If you are using Safari, select ‘preferences’ to open the preferences window. You can then select the
          ‘security’ tab and ‘manage website settings’ to view and change permissions for your camera and microphone.

        <h2 id="photodamaged">What to do if your photo file is damaged</h2>

        <p>
          We run a virus check on the photo of your ID. If the file you upload is infected or damaged, you can try and
          upload another one.
        </p>

        <p>
          If this keeps happening, there might be a problem with your device. Try taking a photo using a different
          device. For example, you can use another phone or tablet that belongs to you or a family member.
        </p>

        <p>
          Send the photo to your usual device and try uploading it again. Or, you can upload your photo from the other
          device just to prove who you are. Once you have proven who you are, you can then use NHS login on your usual
          device as normal.

          2 hours. If you send between 9pm and 9am it may take longer. We will let you know by email whether the ID
          check has been successful.

        <p>
          If you keep getting the same problem, you can prove who you are without photo ID instead.
